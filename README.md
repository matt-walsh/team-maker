This is the final assignment for my Client Side Programming class.

This application leverages the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to create a pokemon team builder. This invloves searching for pokemon based on different criteria (name and type), and adding them to a team of six. As you add and remove pokemon, your average stats are calculated based on the stats of each pokemon on your team.
